<h2/p>Sports have always been a huge part of my life for as long as I can remember. I have played many different sports ever since I was young. My favorites that I’ve played are basketball,softball, and volleyball.</h2>
	<p><font size="+1.95">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basketball is my absolute favorite sport. I have been playing for 8 years. My favorite basketball memory would have to be just spending time with my teammates. I love &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them all so much, and no matter win or loss, we always have a good time. <br>
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven’t been playing softball for very long, but I have grown to love it quickly. It is hard since I have only been playing for one 	year. I love softball season so much &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because it’s warm out, school’s almost over, and everything is perfect.<br>
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a love-hate relationship with volleyball. I love it most of the time, but other times I get frustrated quickly. I like doing my hair before games, and just being with my &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;team. My favorite memory would have to be cheering on the bench. One time the opposing student section called me out and told me to sit down. </font></p>
